Rubylearning
================================

This is a stub for a project to learn the ruby language using MiniTest unit tests.
The idea is, that for each idiom you learn, you write a test case (or two) to
demonstrate how it works. It's also a great way to tinker with new idioms/apis -
by adding assertions you make sure that it actually does what you think it does.

If you structure the files neatly, you get a concise summary of the language
features you've learned for later reference.

As long as the tests run without a failure, you can be sure that what you
see in your notes is actually correct.

Running the files
-----------------
You can run a single file by calling

    ruby about/classes.rb -p

The -p option stands for "pride" and adds coloring to your test output.

if you want to run all tests, call

    ruby all.rb -p
